* Clean
  - consistent Close behavior, including blocking till fully closed
  - CmdAction is ugly
    - the way Cluster.Do works is... iffy. Casting Action to CmdAction feels
      weird
    - If someone were to make a "RetryAction" kind of thing it would not play
      nicely with cluster
  - PoolFunc naming is ugly
  - PubSub stuff is kind of a mess (in what way?)
  - do all the structs types in resp need to be structs?
  - Read through docs, ensure everything is clean and sensical
  - Read through code, make sure all code comments are correct
  - Don't use testify?
  - https://blog.golang.org/subtests
  - update/delete Makefile
